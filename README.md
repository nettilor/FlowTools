# FlowTools
FlowTools is a collection of scripts to help with flow cytometry related tasks and make your lab life easier!

## FlowJo data extractor
The FlowJo data extractor tool is a script based on the [FlowKit](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit) library that allows you to extract a tidy data dataset directly from your FlowJo file.

### Setup
#### 1. Python setup and packages
- First, you need Python on your machine to run this code. I recommend [downloading anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your python installation.
- Now to install the required packages
  - Open your terminal:
    - run "pip install flowkit"
    - run "conda install conda-forge::pysimplegui"
#### 2. Running the script
- Open your terminal
- run "python /path/to/script.py" (on Mac you can drag and drop the script file after writing "python " in the terminal and it will add the right path for you) \
A menu will pop up asking you for the required inputs.
